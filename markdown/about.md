### Who's responsible for this?!

![Cold Beer](http://howlongshouldileavethisbeeroutside.biz/static/img/coldbeer.png)

A quick little project by [Anthony Roldan](http://anthonyroldan.net).

Because there's just no more pressing question when it's cold outside.

howlongshouldileavethisbeeroutside.biz uses gross assumptions, geolocation, and [Newton's Law of Cooling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_heat_transfer#Newton.27s_law_of_cooling) to determine roughly how long it'll take your beer to get cold.

It's probably highly inaccurate and was calibrated with a High Life I left outside once and measured with a Thermapen.

### What else?

If you think this is cool, you'll probably really like [Onthebar](http://www.onthebar.com/). Find out when your favorite bartenders are working on your iPhone - and I bet they even have beer cold for you already.

### Thanks!
