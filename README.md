# How long should I leave my beer outside?

![Cold Beer](http://howlongshouldileavethisbeeroutside.biz/static/img/coldbeer.png)

### Setup

Requires node.js and npm installed.

Clone the repo, then:

```
npm install
coffee server.coffee
```

And it'll be running on `http://localhost:9000`. I host it behind an nginx proxy, but you can do whatever you'd like!
